Hi, I'm Kevin. My generalist approach to problem solving has taken me through a diverse range of experiences which have developed my strong background in electromechanical engineering. I have experience creating a summer camp to teach kids science and engineering, designing an interactive GUI for controlling swarm robotics, debugging and validating power on premium-tier mobile chips, and prototyping robots for applications from animal conservation to medical devices to extraterrestrial exploration.

I'm currently working as a Validation Engineer at Qualcomm, doing power and thermal analysis of our premium tier mobile chipsets. In my free time, I enjoy wrenching on my '91 Miata, working on side projects, and experimenting with landscape photography.
