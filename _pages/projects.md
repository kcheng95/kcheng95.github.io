I've always had the fantasy of owning a fully stocked garage/workshop where I can spend my time working on multiple large-scale and long-term projects at the same time. While I still haven't gotten the space I need for that, I got tired of waiting so I bought a car and a laser cutter so I could start making those dreams a reality. Even if it means have to work on my car in a friends garage 1.5 hours away, and store my laser cutter 2 hours away, limiting a lot of my bigger projects to weekends, I still think they are two of the best purchases I've made to date.
