I've always had the fantasy of owning a fully stocked garage/workshop where I can spend my time working on multiple large-scale and long-term projects at the same time. While I still haven't gotten the space I need for that, I got tired of waiting so I bought a car and a laser cutter so I could start making those dreams a reality. Even if it means have to work on my car in a friends garage 1.5 hours away, and store my laser cutter 2 hours away, limiting a lot of my bigger projects to weekends, I still think they are two of the best purchases I've made to date.

## Laser Cutting

I decided to go with a laser cutter due to the faster turn-around time and increased detail available compared to a 3D printer. Shown above is a 19 x 25 " map of the Bay Area which I designed and made as a gift for a family wedding. I began by researching samples of similar works and running a rough sketch in CAD, eventually deciding on a minimalistic natural wood-grain design. Using snazzymaps as a source, I converted the map data and cut and engraved the main map. After the foreground was cut, I cleaned, sanded, stained, and clear coated both layers. The smaller islands were taped onto a piece of scrap to keep track of and keep from moving during spray coats. Next, the frame was measured, cut, and coated with a black stain and poly coat from some corner moulding. Finally, the entire map was assembled using wood glue, pin nails, and a frame hanger quit.
As a personal touch, the map pins were designed, engraved, cut, clear coated, and backed with 3M poster strips.  This way the bride and groom could attach the pins themselves without risk of damaging the map.

Other projects I've done are custom engraved signs, glassware, and pictures, and I'm currently planning out my next big project.

## 1991 Mazda Miata

When I was looking for a project car, I had two things in mind: 1) Find something to learn to drive manual and 2) Find something that I could do all the maintinance, upgrades, and repairs myself. The pop up headlights just really put the icing on the cake. Some people questioned me when I had to leave the car at a friends house for the first 3 months while it went through basic repairs and I learned to drive stick, but since then it has become both my daily driver, and my racecar. I've done a full tune up, installed a roll bar, and started going to the track to learn more about the car. My plan is to continue to make repairs and upgrades to the car while improving my lap times at track days.
