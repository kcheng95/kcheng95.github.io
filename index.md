Welcome to my website! 

I'm a mechatronics engineer with a BS in Computer Engineering from UCSD and a background in robotics, rapid prototyping, and much more. Here you can find information about myself, my personal projects, recent work experience, and older life experiences worth noting. 

Currently, I'm at Qualcomm working as a Power Validation Engineer.

In my free time, I'm working on designing my next project, working on my car, and building out my hands-on experience.
